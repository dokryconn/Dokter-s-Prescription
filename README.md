#	The "Dok’s Rx Cabinet" folder
The `Dok's Rx Cabinet` folder contains sub-folders for associated scripts/files referenced by the "Dokter's Prescription.EXE" and Dok's Rx Pad.AHK scripts.

The following additional scripts are stored within the`Dok's Rx Cabinet` folders:

- **Ableton Takeover**
- **Power & Sleep Hotkeys**
- **Research Chemicals**

These additional packaged scripts can of course be launched manually from `Dok's Rx Cabinet` and used independently without the "Dokter's Prescription" script running.

*If the “Dok’s Rx Cabinet” folder is not kept within the same location that you are running the `Dokter’s Prescription.EXE` script from, the script may run into an error if a hotkey is pressed and the script is unable to locate the associated file within the `Dok’s Rx Cabinet` folder. In regard to this, if the `Dok's Rx Cabinet` folder gets moved or deleted, you can simply recreate it by launching the “Dokter’s Prescription.EXE” file again. Re-launching the `Dokter's Prescription.EXE` script will not overwrite any existing packaged files in `Dok's Rx Cabinet`. In other words, any changes that you have made to files within `Dok's Rx Cabinet` will not be lost by re-launching `Dokter's Prescription.EXE`*



##	The "Dok’s Rx Pad" folder
The `Dok’s Rx` folder contains the following items referenced by the  **`Dokter's Prescription.EXE`** and **Dok's Rx Pad.AHK** scripts:

- **The "Dok's Rx Pad.AHK" script:**
  - This .AHK script is included for customizing the **Dokter's Prescription** script to meet your desired preferences.

_[Go to the **Customizing Scripts** section](#customizing-scripts) below for more info on this._

- **The "Dok’s Rx Guide.xls" spreadsheet**
  - Includes a full list of default script functions and includes additional workbook tabs for referencing native hotkeys for a few additional programs.

- **The "App Launch Shortcuts" folder**
  - Used for storing created program shortcut files for launching/toggling apps that were installed by Microsoft Store.
  
*The `App Launch Shortcuts` sub-folder within `Dok’s Rx Cabinet\Dok’s Rx` is a location to keep program shortcuts for the "Launch/Toggle Programs" optional template code within the "*Dok's Rx Pad**" script.*

*For example, programs that are downloaded from the Microsoft Store are not located in the standard program location. These programs are usually nested within `C:\Program Files\WindowsApps`. Typically, if you attempt the run the programs directly from their native file location, they will not launch properly. For these instances, you can create a program shortcut for these applications and move it into the `App Launch Shortcuts` folder.*

*i.e. Using the filepath:*

`"%A_WorkingDir%\Dok's Rx\App Launch Shortcuts\Microsoft To Do"`

*instead of:* 

`"C:\Program Files\WindowsApps\Microsoft.Todos_2.28.32802.0_x64__8wekyb3d8bbwe\ToDo.exe"`

- **Icon files referenced by the the "Dok's Rx Pad.AHK" script.**



##	The "Over The Counter" folder
The `Over The Counter` folder contains additional scripts referenced by **`Dokter's Prescription.EXE`** and **Dok's Rx Pad.AHK**. These scripts can also be launched and used independently without the **`Dokter's Prescription.EXE`** or **Dok's Rx Pad.AHK** running. This folder contains:

### The "Ableton Takeover.EXE" script:
 - **Suspends program processes of specified programs while the Ableton Live window is active and resumes the program processes once the Ableton Live window is not active.**
 - **LAUNCH SCRIPT WHILE RUNNING Dokter's Prescription**
    - `[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+A]`
 - **EXIT SCRIPT**
    - `[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+DEL]`

Reference the `Ableton Takeover README.txt` for more info and the complete list of default program processes included in the .EXE version of this script.

An .AHK version of this script is included within `Dok's Rx Cabinet\Over The Counter\Ableton Takeover` for optional customizing. Although the .EXE version of **Ableton Takeover** includes a *decent* list of *common* programs, you can edit this script to include your own program processes that are commonly running while you are using Ableton Live. 

_*[Go to the **Customizing Scripts** section](#customizing-scripts) below for more info on this._



### The "Power & Sleep Hotkeys.EXE" script:
 - Enables hotkeys to sleep, hibernate, restart, or shutdown your PC. 
 - **SLEEP PC**
  - **`[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+ESC]`**
 - **RESART PC**
  - **`[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F5]`**
 - **HIBERNATE PC**
  - **`[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F9]`**
 - **SHUTDOWN PC**
  - **`[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+F12]`**
 - **LAUNCH SCRIPT WHILE RUNNING Dokter's Prescription:**
  - **`[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+P]`**
 - **EXIT SCRIPT:**
  - **`[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+HOME]`**

An .AHK version of this script is included within `Dok's Rx Cabinet\Over The Counter\Power & Sleep` for optional customizing. Although the .EXE version of **Power & Sleep Hotkeys** includes the hotkeys shown above, you can edit this script to adjust the hotkeys for your personal preference. 

_*[Go to the **Customizing Scripts** section](#customizing-scripts) below for more info on this._



# The "Research Chemicals" folder
The `Research Chemicals` folder contains the `Research Chemicals.AHK` script and associated tray icons. The `Research Chemicals.AHK` script is a “testing script” to be used for Autohotkey script development. (Includes Autohotkey's "Window Spy" tool in the tray menu)

### The "Research Chemicals.AHK" script:
This script is used as a separate "tool box" script and for testing Autohotkey functions temporarily.

**NOTE:** The hotkey "**Identify Mouse Cursor Coordinates**" - **`[CTRL+ALT+SHIT+C]`** should be used to calibrate the mouse click hotkeys within **Dokter's Prescription.**

_*[Go to the **Customizing Scripts** section](#customizing-scripts) below for more info on this._

*The Autohotkey software will need to be installed on your computer to run this script, as there is no compiled .EXE version included due to the nature of it's intended usage.*

 - **IDENTIFY MOUSE CURSOR COORDINATES:**
    - `[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+C]`
 - **DISPLAY TEST MESSAGE:**
    - `[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+T]`
 - **LAUNCH SCRIPT WHILE RUNNING Dokter's Prescription:**
    - `[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+R]`
 - **EXIT SCRIPT:**
    - `[CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+DEL]`
 - **SAVE AND RELOAD SCRIPT:**
    - `[CTRL+S]`

### Customizing the "Launch/Toggle Programs" hotkeys in "Dok's Rx Pad.AHK":

**NOTE:** By default, the **Launch/Toggle Programs** hotkeys in **`Dok's Rx Pad,AHK`** are deactivated to keep this portion of the script in a clean, "template code" format. There are detailed instruction comments within the **Dok's Rx Pad.AHK** script file to guide you through customizing the script.

  - The deactivated blocks of code can be activated by removing the `/*`and `*/` brackets for each **Launch/Toggle Programs** hotkey shortcut. 

  - In addition to removing the comment block brackets, you will need to replace portions of the "template code" with the **program name** and **file path** for each desired program. There are detailed instructions on how to customizing these features located in the actual script file via comments labled under: "PLEASE READ - ADJUST FOR YOUR OWN PROGRAMS:""

Once these blocks of code are activated and edited to your personal preference, they will allow you to Launch/Toggle Programs windows using `WIN+(number key)` and/or `WIN+SHIFT+(letter key)` as described previosuly above.

### Calibrating the "Mouse Click Hotkeys" in "Dok's Rx Pad.AHK":

**NOTE:** By default, the **MOUSE CLICK HOTKEYS** in **`Dok's Rx Pad,AHK`** are deactivated to keep this portion of the script in a "template code" format. There are detailed instruction comments within the **Dok's Rx Pad.AHK** script file to guide you through customizing the script.

#### Follow these steps to calibrate the "Mouse Click Hotkeys":

1. Press [CTRL+ALT+SHIFT+C] while running the "Research Chemicals.AHK" script to identify a specific mouse coordinate position to edit these hotkeys
2. Note the mouse coordinates for the X and Y positions that are displayed in the pop-up message box
3. Insert each specific set of coordinates into the "MouseClick" line of code for each mouse click hotkey listed below
4. You have successfully customized the mouse click hotkeys for your own screen resolution. You're done!

 - The deactivated blocks of code can be activated by removing the `/*`and `*/` brackets surrounding the block of code for each deactivated block.
 
Once these blocks of code are activated and edited to your personal preference, they will allow you to click on your specified screen coordinates by using a hotkey.
